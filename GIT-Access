The Atheme GIT repository can be checked out using the following command:
	$ git clone https://github.com/atheme/atheme.git atheme-devel
	$ cd atheme-devel

You should then run these commands to get the source for libmowgli-2 and
the contrib modules. Even if you don't end up needing these, (you did not
enable contrib modules or you have a system-wide libmowgli installation)
you should still fetch the sources, as the build system expects them to
be present.
	$ git submodule init
	$ git submodule update

Atheme's GIT repository depot can be browsed over the internet at 
the following address:
	https://github.com/atheme/atheme/
