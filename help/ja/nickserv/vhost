Help for VHOST:

VHOST allows operators to set a virtual host (also
known as a spoof or cloak) on an account. This vHost
will be set on the user immediately and each time
they identify.

If the nickname is marked, you can override this
using the FORCE keyword.

構文: VHOST <nickname> ON <vHost> FORCE
構文: VHOST <nickname> OFF FORCE
