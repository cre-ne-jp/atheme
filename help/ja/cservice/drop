Help for DROP:

DROP allows you to "unregister" a registered channel.

Once you DROP a channel all of the data associated
with it (access lists, etc) are removed and cannot
be restored.

See help on SET FOUNDER and FLAGS for transferring
a channel to another user.

構文: DROP <#channel>

コマンド例:
    /msg &nick& DROP #foo
