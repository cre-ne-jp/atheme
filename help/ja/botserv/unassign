Help for UNASSIGN:

Unassigns a bot from a channel. When you use this command,
the bot won't join the channel anymore. However, bot
configuration for the channel is kept, so you will always
be able to reassign a bot later without having to reconfigure
it entirely.

構文: UNASSIGN <chan>

コマンド例:
    /msg &nick& UNASSIGN #help
