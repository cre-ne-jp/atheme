Help for BOT:

Allows opers to create, modify, and delete bots
that users will be able to use on their own channels.

BOT ADD adds a bot with the given nickname, username,
hostname and realname. Since no integrity checks are done
for these settings, be careful.

BOT CHANGE allows you to change nickname, username, hostname
or realname of a bot without actually deleting it (and all
the data associated with it).

BOT DEL removes the given bot from the bot list.

Note: you cannot create a bot that has a nick that is
currently registered. If an unregistered user is currently
using the nick, they will be killed.

構文: BOT ADD <nick> <user> <host> <real>
構文: BOT CHANGE <oldnick> <newnick> [<user> [<host> [<real>]]]
構文: BOT DEL <nick>
