Help for CERT:

CERT maintains a list of CertFP fingerprints that will allow
&nick& to recognize you and authenticate you automatically.

You cannot add the same fingerprint to multiple accounts.

CERT is agnostic with regard to the fingerprint format,
which depends on the IRCd. If in question, use the CERT ADD
command without any arguments, which will add the current
fingerprint to the list, or ask network staff.

Syntax: CERT LIST
Syntax: CERT ADD [fingerprint]
Syntax: CERT DEL <fingerprint>
Syntax: CERT CLEAR
#if priv user:auspex

Operators with user:auspex privilege can also
view another user's fingerprint list.

Syntax: CERT LIST <nick>
#endif

Examples:
    /msg &nick& CERT LIST
    /msg &nick& CERT ADD
    /msg &nick& CERT ADD f3a1aad46ca88e180c25c9c7021a4b3a
    /msg &nick& CERT DEL f3a1aad46ca88e180c25c9c7021a4b3a
    /msg &nick& CERT CLEAR
